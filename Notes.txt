Introduction to React 

Developing SPA - Single Page Application [Authentication/Authorization] [MERN - MongoDB/Express/React JS/Node JS]

functions written with function keyword - has implicit binding with "this" keyword and because of implicit binding the owner of this keyword may get changed place to place

functions written with arrow function syntax - does not have implicit binding with "this" keyword hence the context/owner change will never happen

for example - 

const Customer={

	customerId:1000,
	contactName:"Pravinkumar R. D.",
	city:"Pune",
	printCustomer:function(){
		setTimeout(()=>{
			console.log(`{this.contactName}`);
		},2000);
	}
}

Window.setTime()

Customer.printCustomer(); //Pravinkumar R. D.

Preferred Language is JSX - JavaScript Extension

	Component file extensions will always .JSX
	Component Name [File] should be Capital Camel Casing [HelloWorld.jsx]
	Per Component create its external CSS file [HelloWorld.css]


ESM - ECMAScript Module is a JavaScript file which contains [import and export statements] [.js/jsx/ts/tsx]

Export - default export and named export
	only one default export per module
	as many named exports as you want

	named exports while importing must be enclosed in {one, two, three}
	default export will be imported without {} brackets

Configure Bootstrap CSS Framework - 

npm install bootstrap

main.jsx  

//third-party Framework 
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js';

In React - All CSS properties are defined as camelCase properties
	for Example - textAlign:'center'

Custom CSS - 
	1) In-line CSS - with the help of style attribute
	2) Document level CSS
	3) External CSS as a module [CSS As-A Module]
